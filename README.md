# EDA_USED_CAR_DATA
There is an automobile company XYZ which aspires to enter the Used-car market by setting up their company locally to give competition to their counterparts.

They want to understand the factors affecting the pricing of cars in the market, since those may be very different from the new car market. Essentially, the company wants to know:
• Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a used car?
• How well those variables describe the price of a car
Based on various market surveys, the consulting firm has gathered a large dataset of different types of used cars across the market.

What is Expected?
Being a data analyst, you must come up a first step document that lists output of your exploratory analysis, any issues or problems you may see with data that need follow up, and some basic descriptive analysis that you think highlights important outcomes/findings from the data. Based on your findings, the next level of analysis will be charted out.
